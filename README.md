#Sean Dlutkiewicz Red Hat Experience

#Monday

Fortune gave us a presentation on Agile, which is a project management approach that breaks down the project into steps. These steps are planning, executing and evaluating.

We built potato heads and broke down what we will do, what we’re doing and what’s done.
After that, we evaluated our final product and what went well, what didn’t go well and new ideas we came up with to fix what didn’t go well.

#Tuesday

On Tuesday we had a Git and GitHub workshop. We used our laptops and used the command line.

#Wednesday

On Wednesday we built rollercoasters using straws, tin foil, boxes and masking tape. We had about 5 hours, and we were in groups of 3 - 4.
My team won.
At some point of the day we listened to the interns talk about ai, and another one about college life.

#Thursday

On Thursday we had a town hall meeting. After that we had breakfast and then chilled out. We played pool and some Nintendo. Then we had a Python workshop, where we fixed a ball game.

#Friday

On Friday we used microbit to make working toy cars, and raced them on a track.
